# THE MU BIBLE

## The Book of Matthew

### Chapter 1
This is an attempt to be a compendium of knowledge related to Project Mu. Seperate from the docs which talk mostly about why Mu is and little about how Mu is. It is doing fine, thanks for asking. This is an attempt to convey to you the complexity and nuances of the UEFI world and will likely be at least somewhat out of date by the time you finish reading it.

There are a few major questions this bible hopes to address. As is the nature of most technical bibles, this will likely leave you with many more questions than when you started reading. This bible will attempt to address:
 + What is UEFI?
   + Where did it come from?
   + Why did it need to exist?
   + How does it work?
 + What is EDK II?
   + Where did it come from?
   + How does it relate to Project Mu?
   + How is it different to Project Mu?
   + How does it work?
   + It works like that?! *How* does that even work?
 + What is Project Mu?
   + Why is it different from all those others UEFI's?
   + How does Project Mu work?
   + Why did you make Project Mu?
 + How do I use Project Mu?
 + How can I contribute back to Project Mu?
